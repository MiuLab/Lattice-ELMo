Source code for our ACL 2020 paper *Learning Spoken Language Representations with Neural Lattice Language Modeling*

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.6
* Install the required Python packages with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Dataset
Unfortunately, we are not allowed to redistribute ATIS, SWDA and MRDA.
We provide a transcribed and processed dataset of the SNIPS NLU benchmark, where the audio files were generated with a TTS system, for training and evaluation.

#### Create a custom dataset
If you would like to create your custom dataset with lattices generated by your own Kaldi ASR models, please refer to the Preprocessing section [here](https://github.com/MiuLab/Lattice-SLU/blob/master/README.md)

## How to run
The training configs are located in [models](models).

### Steps
To train baseline models using ASR 1-best output with or without ELMo embeddings:

```
# For static word embeddings
python3 main.py ../models/snips_tts/asr/1

# For pre-trained ELMo embeddings
python3 main.py ../models/snips_tts/asr/2
```

To evaluate a classifier
```
python3 main.py --test --best_valid {classifier_model_dir}
```

To train a baseline LatticeLSTM classifier using ASR lattice
```
python3 main.py ../models/snips_tts/lattice/1
```

To train a LatticeLSTM classifier with pretrained ELMo embeddings
```
python3 main.py ../models/snips_tts/lattice/2
```

To fine-tune ELMo with lattices
```
python3 main_lm.py ../models/snips_tts/lattice/lm/1
```

To train a LatticeLSTM classifier with fine-tuned ELMo embeddings, you might want to modify the checkpoint number in the config.
```
python3 main.py ../models/snips_tts/lattice/3
```
